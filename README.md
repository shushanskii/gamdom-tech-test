- **Redux** (state management)
- **Redux-Saga** (for handling side effects)
- **NVM** (Node Version Manager) - recommended for managing the Node.js version
- **ESLint** (for code linting and maintaining code quality)
- **Styled Components** (for styling components in a modular way)
- **Floating UI** (for creating dynamic and efficient floating UI elements)
- **Commitlint** (for enforcing commit message conventions)
- **Husky** (for managing Git hooks to ensure consistent commit practices)
